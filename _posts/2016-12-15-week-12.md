    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We worked together and also we used our own thoughts rather than asking other people which is usually one thing we did. We didn't give up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well what limited our learning was that we didn't know what to do at first as the robot arm was completely new for me and Zain. But I felt like we did very well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time we will have more experience on the robot arm and we will be able to work faster and more efficiently. Can't wait for next week</td>
