  Good                                              Good and bad social media

You can contact your friends

Communicate when you need help

Keep in touch with old friends

Lots of news online and we can learn a lot

Bad

Bad people can harass you online.

You dont know whos behind the screen

Not private in some forms.

Bullying. A good way to do it is on social media.

I think social media is absoloutly fine if you use it correctly.
