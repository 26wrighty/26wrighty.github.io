In today's lesson we focused on positives and negatives of social media. In groups of three we came up with some ideas on a google document. After we had done this we saw a video on twitter. The video was trying to say that everybody’s going over the top and taking photos of their food and shoes. It was showing us that people are addicted to twitter.

What do you think?
