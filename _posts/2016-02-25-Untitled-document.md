I thought it was really fun making my identity map. It bought back memories of when I was younger. I didn't really mind sharing my identity map to the class as I have nothing to hide really. It really helped me to get to know other people in the class a bit better. I was quite weird commenting on other people’s identity map. It was cool to see what people put on your comment box. There wasn’t much surprise in the comments most of them were just like " more writing". It’s much easier to comment online as because you don’t have so much pressure. I think it did a bit but not hugely. As I don’t know what I want to be when i’m older. Yh I think it did. I used to just comment anything but know I think twice before I comment things.
