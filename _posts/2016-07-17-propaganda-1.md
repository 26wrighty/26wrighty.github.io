Propaganda is very misleading. For example there was lots of propaganda from both sides in the EU referedem trying to scare or mislead you to vote for the side. Like they said all the money that they earned from winning would go to the NHS. And of course it did'nt. Propaganda is not a good thing and I personally think itâ€™s putting people of voting and also acting about things. Propaganda is very scary mainly for people who it can affect and I think most of it should be stopped.
