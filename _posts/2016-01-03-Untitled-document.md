For the last homework some people got a bit muddled up about posting their test page. Mr keen (the best IT teacher) showed us a page on github. The page told you where you had gone wrong. We also finished our about pages. Now we have all got an avatar and have successfully posted a blog. Now we can view each others blogs which is really cool so we can learn from others. Todays lesson was really fun Mr keen gave us some pointers and we got on with the work. 

We also used html colour picker I chose electric green which is my favourite colour. Now the background of my vlog will be green. Do email me if you want me to change it my email is [will.wright@challoners.org](mailto:will.wright@challoners.org). I hope you have enjoyed my vlog so far.

 Thanks, Will
