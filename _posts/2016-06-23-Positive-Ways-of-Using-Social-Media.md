**Positive Ways of Using Social Media And Being Connected**

When I have been connected with my friends when they have helped me with my homework

When I have talked to people I haven't seen in a long time

Communicating with my moms so u can go out by yourself. 

Texting an old friend so you can meet up with them. 

Texting to inform people about dates of house events.

    

Calling my mum so she knows I need to be picked up from school 

Inviting people round to your house 

Letting your family know where you are as you could be lost in a zoo.

Making friends with your friends friends.

On holiday you can still keep in touch with your friends to make sure they don't think you hate them.

If you want to tell your mum you're going to be late home. 

If you got timing mixed up after a football game you could ring your mummy amd daddy
