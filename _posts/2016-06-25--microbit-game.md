Heres what it will look like(but with no writing in the middle)

**Calculator programme: **I will have to programme the score so it adds up every time you score and also the time left in the game.

**Outputs:** Boundaries,moving ball,moving the platform.

**How to win: **To win you have to deflect the ball of the platform to other side and try and get it past your opponent. The person with the most goals after 3mins is the winner.
