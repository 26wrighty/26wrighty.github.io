  <tr>
    <td>I think I learned well, working with minimal conversation with other people and not get carried away with other things like my blog. Unlike last week… We started working with these really awesome LED lights. It was a new thing but I thought we picked it up easily.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The only thing that limited my learning was people asking for help on the LED lights section. I felt me and Zain worked really well this week.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think for next time we will be a bit faster as at the start we were just trying to get a grip with the LED lights and that was a pain and thats probaly what held us back this lesson. But i guess we were still learning!</td>
