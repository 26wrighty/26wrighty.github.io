In todays lesson we focused mainly on adverts. We learned about all sorts of media but we looked into adverts and how they can have an underlying message. We watched the kia video about three hamsters. The message was saying that if you buy this car you will become very popular. There can also be a hidden message like the price.

Homework: Go on google classroom there will be a write up and some questions about the advert that we can choose.
