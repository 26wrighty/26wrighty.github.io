Here is my speaking piece                                         Variety is the spice of life

Music, there are so many types of it that we cant remember all of them for example there's fun music that cheered the soldiers up when they went off to war. There’s also war music to scare you opponent like the Hakka.

We have music that brings people together like in an orchestra everybody comes from a different background. In Africa they use lots of drums and sing together they think that if you play music together it makes the gods happy. In India some music is a way of telling everyone that its time to pray. There is so much variety in music. And its what the entire world can do together without gunfire, bombs and fear. The thing is that the same 12 notes make up all these different types of music. It's amazing that all this variety is made by 12 notes, there are 196 countries in the world and every single A **military band** is a group of personnel that performs musical duties for military functions, usually for the [armed forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_forces). A typical military band consists mostly of wind and percussion instruments. The [conductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting) of a band commonly bears the title of [Bandmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandmaster) or [Director of Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_Music). [Ottoman military bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_military_band) are thought to be the oldest variety of military marching band in the world, dating from the 13th century.[1]

The military band should be capable of playing ceremonial and [marching music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_music), including the [national anthems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem) and [patriotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotic) songs of not only their own nation but others as well, both while stationary and as a [marching band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_band). Military bands also play a part in military [funeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral) ceremonies.

                           AFRICA

 Given the vastness of the continent, the traditional **music of Africa** is historically ancient, rich, and diverse, with the different [regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Africa) and [nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries) of [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa) having many distinct [musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music) traditions?

Traditional music in much of the continent is passed down orally (or aurally) and is not written. In [Sub-Saharan African music traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_African_music_traditions), it also frequently relies heavily on percussion instruments of every variety, including [xylophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylophone), [drums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drums), and tone-producing instruments such as the [mbira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbira) or "thumb piano."[1][2]

The music and dance of the [African diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_diaspora), formed to varying degrees on African musical traditions, include [American music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_the_United_States) and many [Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_music) genres, such as [Soca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soca_music), [Calypso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calypso_music) (see [kaiso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiso)) and [Zouk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouk). [Latin American music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_music) genres such as the [Bachata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachata_(music)), [Danzón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danz%C3%B3n), [Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba), [Rumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumba), [Salsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa_music), [Tango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango), [Cumbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbia), [Bomba del Chota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomba_(Ecuador)), [Mambo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambo_(dance)), [Merengue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merengue_(dance)), [Reggae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae), [Compas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compas), [Milonga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milonga_(dance)), [Son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_(music)), [Guaracha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaracha), [Punta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punta), [Cha-Cha-Cha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)), [Plena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plena), [Conga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conga), and other [clave (rhythm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clave_(rhythm))-based genres, were also founded on the music of [enslaved Africans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_slave_trade), and have in turn influenced

                                    Indian music

The **music of India** includes multiple varieties of [folk music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music), [pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music), and [Indian classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_classical_music). [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)'s classical [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music) tradition, including [Hindustani music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_music) and [Carnatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music), has a history spanning millennia and developed over several eras. Music in India began as an integral part of socio-religious life.

Music was invented over 1.7 million years ago but the oldest musical instrument is about 40,000 years old. It was a hollowed out tree trunk by termites. 

                                                                                                      This appears to be borne out by the archaeological evidence. While the first hand axes and spears date back about 1.7 million years and 500,000 years respectively, the earliest known musical instruments are **[just 40,000 years ol**d](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/science/oldest-musical-instruments-are-even-older-than-first-thought.html?_r=0).

But of course are voices are classed as musical instruments.

Your favorite song is probably associated with an emotional event.

Flowers can grow faster whilst listening to music

Leo fender the inventor of a telecaster could not play the guitarThis appears to be borne out by the archaeological evidence. While the first hand axes and spears date back about 1.7 million years and 500,000 years respectively, the earliest known musical instruments are **[just 40,000 years ol**d](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/science/oldest-musical-instruments-are-even-older-than-first-thought.html?_r=0).

               When was music used in the war

                                                                                                                   

During the American Civil War, music played a prominent role on both sides of the conflict: [Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)) and [Confederate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America). On the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) battlefield, different instruments including [bugles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugle_(instrument)), [drums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum), and [fifes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife_(musical_instrument)) were played to issue marching orders or sometimes simply to boost the morale of one's fellow soldiers. Singing was also employed as a recreational activity, but as a release from the inevitable tensions that come with fighting in a war, particularly a war in which the issue of freedom of a race is to be decided. In camp, music was a diversion away from the bloodshed, helping the soldiers deal with homesickness and boredom. Soldiers of both sides often engaged in recreation with musical instruments, and when the opposing armies were near each other, sometimes the bands from both sides of the conflict played against each other on the night before a battle.

Each side had its particular favorite tunes, while some music was enjoyed by Northerners and Southerners alike, as exemplified by [United States President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_President) [Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln)'s love of *[Dixi*e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_(song)), the unofficial anthem of the Confederacy. To this day, many of the songs are sung when a patriotic piece is required. The war's music also inspired music artists such as [Lynyrd Skynyrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynyrd_Skynyrd) and [Elvis Presley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley).

                                    C major

major is one of the most common key signatures used in western music. Most [transposing instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposing_instrument) playing in their home key are notated in C major; for example, a [clarinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarinet) in B♭ sounding a [B-flat major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-flat_major) scale is notated as playing a C major scale. The white keys of the [piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano) correspond to the C major scale. Among [brass instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_instrument), the contra-bass [tuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuba) is in C. A pedal [harp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harp) tuned to C major has all of its pedals in the middle position

11th century book Divânu Lügati't-Türk mentions prototype of [Mehtaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehtaran), [Turkish military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_military) band tradition.[2] Bands were formed by soldiers.[3][4] 17th century traveler [Evliya Çelebi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evliya_%C3%87elebi) noted that the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) had 40 guilds of musicians in 1670's [Istanbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul).[5] Ottoman military bands influenced European equivalents.[6] Each regiment in the British Army maintained its own military band. Until 1749 bandsmen were civilians hired at the expense of the colonel commanding a regiment. Subsequently they became regular enlisted men [7] who accompanied the unit on active service to provide morale enhancing music on the battlefield or, from the late nineteenth century on, to act as stretcher-bearers. Instruments during the 18th century included fifes, drums, the oboe ([hautbois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hautbois)), French horn, clarinet and bassoon. Drummers summoned men from their farms and ranches to muster for duty. In the chaotic environment of the battlefield, musical instruments were the only means of commanding the men to advance, stand or retire. In the mid 19th century each smaller unit had their own fifer and drummer, who sounded the daily routine. When units massed for battle a band of musician's war

Throughout World War I, music was a prominent feature on the home fronts and the battlefields. Most homes had a piano, and at least one member of each family knew how to play it, providing a common form of entertainment and socialization. Popular music, therefore, saturated the citizenry and reached into all of its corners, forming a great medium for conveying messages. Recognizing this capability, governments often used it as an effective means for inspiring fervor, pride, patriotism, and action in the citizens in order to gain manpower, homeland support, and funds. Composers and publishers readily cooperated and adopted these new musical motifs with which to earn money from a large population rallied by war and eager to respond to the sentiments by purchasing the pro-war music. Besides these incentives, composers and publishers often wrote music to promote their personal wartime sentiments. Dramatic graphics and additional messages printed on sheet music provided extra inspiration to the messages expressed by the lyrics and melodies, markedly increasing their capabilities as propaganda vehicles. Music during World War I was often used to inspire passion and voluntary compliance in the listeners and, occasionally, shame in those who didn't support the war. Much of the music distributed during World War I greatly influenced social and political attitudes, thereby serving as an effective propaganda tool for private citizens and governments.

Music also cheered up the women who's husbands and boyfriends where at war a key person to do this was Glenn miller he had a fantastic band and he sung a famous song called in the mood. It really put people in a great mood.

The American military band traditions date from the British era. From the American Revolutionary War onward military bands marched in the same manner as their French counterparts.

During the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) most [Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army) regiments had both types of groups within the unit. However, due to changes in [military tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tactics) by the end of [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) field musical had been mostly phased out in favor of the brass bands - themselves the basis for today's US civil brass band culture and traditions. These performed in a concert setting for entertainment, as well as continued to perform drill and martial events. In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), these bands were increased in instrumentation to include [woodwinds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodwinds), leading to the modern [military band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._military_bands) in the United States, and [high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school) and [college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College) [marching bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_band) and [concert bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_band).

Field music is also popular with many organizations such as police, fire, and veterans groups maintaining pipe and drum, fife and drum, or drum and bugle corps. Starting in the late 17th century with the birth of the regular Russian armed services, each unit of the Imperial army and navy formed their own bands using regular enlisted personnel and NCOs and led by officers as directors of music and bandmasters. This tradition stayed even in the Soviet era, and one of the finest band conductors of that era was Major General Semeon Chernetsky, who founded and became the first director of music of the Central Band of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union from 1927 to 1951. Indeed, Russia has a long tradition of military bands and so many military marches have been composed by various composers through the years.

                    RUSSIAN MILTARY

Today, military bands in the Russian Federation are also of the headquarters element from the regimental level onward, and also provide musical support to the different units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Federal Protective Service, the Federal Security Service and the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The military bands here also provide musical support in civil and military events, in a wide range of groups and ensembles. Some can even continue the old Russian military band traditions by donning the old imperial military uniforms of the Russian Empire, especially the uniforms of the bands. Examples of such are the Central Band of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, the Exemplary Band of the Moscow Garrison Guard of Honor, the St. Petersburg Admiralty Band, the Central Band of the Western Military District and the

 Functions and duties[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_band&action=edit&section=4)]OF MILITARY BANDS

Military bands can vary in function and duties based on their specific mission. Bands may perform for a variety of reasons such as special events, military review, public relations or troop entertainment.

Military bands play ceremonial and [marching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching) music, including the [national anthems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthems) and [patriotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotic) songs. A concert band's repertoire includes original [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_instrument) compositions, arrangements of [orchestral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestral) compositions, [light music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_music), popular tunes and [concert marches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_march) found in [standard repertoire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_concert_band_literature) Modern-day military musicians often perform a variety of other styles of music in different ensembles, from [chamber music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music) to [rock and roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll). It is the same case in the other services as

The **music of Africa** is as vast and varied as the continent's many regions, nations, and ethnic groups. The African [continent](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Continent) comprises approximately 20 percent of the world's land mass and has a population of roughly 934 million. African music is as diverse as its cultures and peoples and has flowered in many indigenous forms as well as been shaped by foreign influences.

Although there are many different varieties of music in Africa, there are a number of common elements to the music, especially within regions. The concept of music in Africa, especially in [sub-Saharan Africa](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Sub-Saharan_Africa) bears a difference from other regions and [cultures](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Culture). The roles of [music](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Music) and dance are tightly woven together in sub-Saharan Africa, and music intersects with every aspect of life, expresses [life](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Life) through the medium of sound. By helping mark the important moments in life, music helps to underscore the divine and eternal value of [human](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Human) life.

African music also helps to connect people together in a variety of ways, strengthening the fabric of the [community](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Community), which in turn reinforces people's commitment to support each other and the community, toward mutual health and prosperity. Another crucial role of music in Africa is as a mode of [communication](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Communication). Talking drums, signal drums, [songs](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Song), and the sagas of the historian griots each communicate different types of important information. well.
