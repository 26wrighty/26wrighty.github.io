This year in I.C.T. it has been tough and fun at the same time. Mr Keen has pushed us to our best. I have loved this year. My favourite subject was Prezi as I enjoyed zooming in and out of different slides.

Other things we have done our 

1. Scratch

2. Coding

3. Adverts

4. Social media and our social lives

5. Twitter and face books.

Our blogs have been fun but very complicated to fix. I have enkoyed me blogs and I like having my own websites.

Thank you for the support!
